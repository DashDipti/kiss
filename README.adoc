= KISS - Keep it simple, stupid.

This is an attempt to keep things simple and capture lot of 'how-to-dos' activities which are done on a day to day basis by us in the Cloudera world and in general. The attempt is to simplify as much as possible.
While tryind to do so it may become little lengthier. So, bear with me on this and happy kissing. :)
